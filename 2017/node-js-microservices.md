#Microservices (MS)
  - Small autonomous services that work together

#8 principles of MS
  1. Modeled around business domains
  2. Culture of automation
    - MS fails if it doesn't automate
      - ex: having to write a code each time you deploy
    - Testing - has to be working when deployed
  3. Hide implementation details
  4. Decentralize all the things
  5. Deploying independently
  6. Consumer first
    - Service Discovery
  7. Isolate failure
    - One ms should not bring down your whole application 
  8. Highly Observable

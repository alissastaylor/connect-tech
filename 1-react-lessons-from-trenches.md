#Ways to Organize
  - Organize by feature or design
  - Or organize by route
  - Keep code close 
  - Give naming extra thought
  - Combine reducers into separate state
  - Use the same structure for action type and state
  - Put actions into their own folder
  - Greppable Code
    -name them so they are easy to search for 
  - Selectors free the state structure

#What does your README say? (Readme Driven Development)
  - Write the README first 
  - Add desc and foals
  - Add examples
  - Share to get feedback
  - Most important doc to write 

#When to create a pull request?
  - decide on things together, make a "paper trail" incase anyone wants to know why you did something a certain way

#NPM Script
  - Run npm start for a list of commands
  - Simple to use, wasy to see how to do things
